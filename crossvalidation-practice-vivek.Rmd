## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(MultiPhen)
??Multiphen
R.version.string


library(ISLR)
data(Auto)
fix(Auto)
summary(Auto)
set.seed(1)
dim(Auto)
train=sample(392,196)
fix(train)
train
lm.fit=lm(mpg~horsepower,data=Auto,subset=train)
summary(lm.fit)



```


```{r}
## test

test3 <- 4
